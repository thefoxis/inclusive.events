      <h2 class="f3 m0">Become a patron</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy">Self-publishing a book is a challenging endeavour. To ensure high quality of the publication, I’m looking for financial backing to cover the costs of hiring an editor, an illustrator and offering renumeration to individuals I’m planning to interview. My goals for diversity and producing a possible print edition will also present financial challenges.</p>
      <p class="lh-copy">The book will come with <strong>10 limited patron spots</strong> for organisations—people who believe in and demonstrate their investment in diversity and inclusion on a internal level and beyond. </p>
      
      <h3 class="f4">How does it work?</h3>
      <p class="lh-copy">As a patron you’ll get:</p>
      <ul class="lh-copy">
        <li>An organisation name, website and a 200-word blurb placed at the back of the book.</li>
        <li>A copy of the book.</li>
        <li>Organisation’s logo on the site highlighting your support for diversity and inclusion causes.</li>
        <li>A heartfelt thank you on social media and a blog post describing your organisation’s committment to diversity and inclusion.</li>
